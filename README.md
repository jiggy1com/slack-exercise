slack coding exercise

This exercise is meant to demonstrate:

The ability to access to a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
The ability to display that data on a page using only native JavaScript (no libraries); and
The ability to update the UI of a page without refreshing the page.
I'd like you to create a web page that shows a photo in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title. You can use any public API that returns photos; here are some ideas:

* Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html
* Instagram: http://instagram.com/developer/
* Google Image Search: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview
* Yahoo Image Search: https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/
